## classification

Script for explainability of classifiers. The dataset has 13 input features and one output class. The explainability methods used are LIME, SHAP, and DiCE. The models tested include a Naive Bayes, a Decision Tree, a Random Forest, a Gradient Boosting Classifier, and a Neural Network. For adversarial methods, a Polynomial Classifier is tested.

## regression

Script for explainability of regressors. The dataset has 6 input features and 1 output. The explainability methods used are LIME, SHAP, and DiCE. The models tested include a Linear Regressor, a Decision Tree, a Random Forest, a Gradient Boosting Regressor, and a Neural Network. For adversarial methods, a Polynomial Classifier is tested.
