# NN Explanability

In this part of the project we will work with the deeplift library in order to achieve explainability on a DNN model.

Prereq: In order to run this script, you have to follow these simple steps:
1) Install python 3.7.17 on your machine
2) In this subfolder (/path/to/project/folder/deeplift) you need to create a virtual environment:
    to do so, run the command `python -m venv ./\<name-of-the-venv\>`
3) Activate the virtual environment with `source ./\<name-of-the-venv\>/bin/activate`
4) Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5) Run the program (usually `python main.py` or `python3.7 main.py`)

NB: once you are finished, please remember to deactivate the virtual environment with `deactivate`.
